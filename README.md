Project Bracket Team 6 Fall 2022 Project

Intro: 

Hi, I'm one of the project managers on Team 6 in Project Bracket.This project was started sometime around October, with roughly 16 members. As college and personal matters got in the way of many of our members, progression on the project has slowed down.

This project is a social platform for students to share resources from different classes. 

The front end of this program was created using Flutter and Dart.
